## 📌 Module: ORM with Hibernate

This module implements **Customer Management** with Hibernate ORM — replacing JDBC and emphasizing clean separation between layers.

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

This system follows a strict **Layered + MVC** architecture pattern:

---

## 📋 Features

* **Customer Management:** Add, update, delete, and view customer details.
* **Item Management:** Manage product inventory. *(Planned)*
* **Order Processing:** Create and manage customer orders. *(Planned)*

## 🏛️ Architecture

This project strictly follows a layered architecture to separate concerns and improve maintainability.

* **Controller Layer:** Manages the UI (JavaFX) and user interactions.
* **Service (BO) Layer:** Handles all business logic and orchestrates data flow.
* **DAO Layer:** Responsible for all data access operations, abstracting the database from the rest of the application.
* **DTO Layer:** Data Transfer Objects used to carry data between layers.
* **Factory Pattern:** A `DAOFactory` is used to provide the necessary DAO implementations to the service layer, promoting loose coupling.
