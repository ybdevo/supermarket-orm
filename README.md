## 🏛️ Architecture

This project strictly follows a layered architecture to separate concerns and improve maintainability.

* **Controller Layer:** Manages the UI (JavaFX) and user interactions.
* **Service (BO) Layer:** Handles all business logic and orchestrates data flow.
* **DAO Layer:** Responsible for all data access operations, abstracting the database from the rest of the application.
* **DTO Layer:** Data Transfer Objects used to carry data between layers.
* **Factory Pattern:** A `DAOFactory` is used to provide the necessary DAO implementations to the service layer, promoting loose coupling.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Java / JavaFX:** For the core application and user interface.
* **JDBC:** For database connectivity.
* **MySQL:** As the backend database.
* **Git & GitHub:** For version control.
